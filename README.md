## VR Proposal 
For my VR interface task I thought that since the our team has chosen to make a horror game I could make a small horror game based in one of the levels. The idea of the game is you stand in one spot in the room and you have to look around, I might have it so one of the controllers is a torch (unsure of how hard this is to do) and you have to look around for "good items", these will put your imagination meter down when collected. If your imagination meter goes all the way up then you lose and there will be some sort of jump scare, it's kind of going to be like whack a mole where the items will only spawn for a certain time before they dissappear and they will come and go quicker, I will also try and implement a score system to see who gets the highest score.
