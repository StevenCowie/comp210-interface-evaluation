									<h1>Methods</h1>
								  <h2>Qualitative Data</h2>
								  <p>The first method I have decided to use to collect the data is an interview with questions about the game which will help me to focus on certain areas for my questionnaire. I interviewed four people as three to five people were the prime amount to detect issues in the game. Three of the four are games academy students and the other one hardly ever plays games which I thought was a good idea as they could I tried to keep my questions quite broad and have more of a discussion with them so they could highlight all the things they thought could have been done better, this way I got very in depth answers. I got the people I was interviewing to play though the tutorial and play a few games as well as navigate the menus so they could get a feel of the whole game and detect any problems.</p>

								  <h2>Quantitative Method</h2>
									<p>The second method I used to collect my data was a questionnaire which I got twenty of my peers and friends to complete so I had a larger sample size compared with the interviews. The larger sample size gave me a better indication of what people thought about the game. The questions asked what people thought about the game but also had some focused just on the the aspects people didn't like as mentioned above which were the tutorial and the controls. I got them to play through the tutorial the same as before and let them play the game until they felt ready to answer the questions I had given them.</p>

								  <h2>Timed Task</h2>
								  <p>The third method I used to collect my data was getting my interviewees to do a timed task in the game. The task was to play through the tutorial so the game could explain the controls and then complete one match, however there was an issue where the tutorial had down the wrong controls for the movement controls, so people had to figure this out for themselves. I then stopped the timer and wrote down their results. </p>
