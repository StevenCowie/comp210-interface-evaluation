							<h1>Kick Your Astronaut</h1>
						  <p>Kick your astronaut is a Squirrelsoft Studios game designed in Unity.You play as an astronaut and take part in variety of fun mini games featuring different objectives such as deathmatch, space hockey, grab the belt and dodge the crate. It is set in a spaceship and is desgined for the casual gamer. The game can be played by yourself or with friends to make it even more fun!</p>
							<p>This website is desgined as an interface evalution report in which I looked into what can be improved about the game. I did this by carrying out three types of tests. </p>

									<h1>Methods</h1>
								  <h2>Qualitative Data</h2>
								  <p>The first method I have decided to use to collect the data is an interview with questions about the game which will help me to focus on certain areas for my questionnaire. I interviewed four people as three to five people were the prime amount to detect issues in the game. Three of the four are games academy students and the other one hardly ever plays games which I thought was a good idea as they could see if people who didn't play games would struggle. I tried to keep my questions quite broad and have more of a discussion with them so they could highlight all the things they thought could have been done better, this way I got very in depth answers. I got the people I was interviewing to play though the tutorial and play a few games as well as navigate the menus so they could get a feel of the whole game and detect any problems and report back to me. </p>

								  <h2>Quantitative Method</h2>
								  <p>The second method I used to collect my data was a questionnaire which I got twenty of my peers and friends to complete so I had a larger sample size compared with the interviews. The larger sample size gave me a better indication of what people thought about the game. The questions asked what people thought about the game but also had some focused just on the the aspects people didn't like as mentioned above which were the tutorial and the controls. I got them to play through the tutorial the same as before and let them play the game until they felt ready to answer the questions I had given them. Most of the questions were done in the form of a scale so it is easier to show my results.</p>

								  <h2>Timed Task</h2>
								  <p>The third method I used to collect my data was getting my interviewees to do a timed task in the game. The task was to play through the tutorial so the game could explain the controls and how to play, then complete one match, however there was an issue where the tutorial had down the wrong controls for the movement controls, so people had to figure this out for themselves. I then stopped the timer and wrote down their results. The results were surprising.</p>

						  <p>The spreadsheet below is the raw data that I recieved for my questionnaire's I did. I asked twenty willing participants who were my friends and fellow students to play the game and then fill this out so I can gather the information needed for my discussion and conclusion.</p>

						  <h1>Discussion</h1>
						  <p>My results show several findings about the game. I think my most obvious finding looking at my results is people did not like the tutorial at all however when people took the time to read the controls before playing the tutorial they they found out the tutorial was more useful as shown below.</p>
						  <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=908870113&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
						  <p>The graph above illustrates a positive coorelation proving my point above. To back this point up when I was interviewing people three of them did not read the controls however the only female did and she grasped them a lot quicker than the other three as she wasn't having to try and figure out if certain controls were broken or switched else where on the keyboard. The next observation I made from this one was that people who found the controls easier to use felt more immersed in the game as shown below.</p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=1052397027&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p> The graph above also shows a positive coorelation showing the easier the controls are in a game the more immersed a player feels in the game. </p>
							<p> Players who took their time to read the last page of the tutorial where it mentioned the objective and how to win found the tutorial to be more useful than people who skipped the reading on the page because it had no controls on it.</p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=904427140&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=670017115&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p> No one gave the controls the top mark for ease of use. The only players who gave them a four were the ones who read the controls from the menu at the start of the game. This proves that they need improvement as the vast majoirty of responses marked them down at only one or two. </p>
							<p> Although the controls were proven to not be the best the vast majority of users ranked the menus very easy to use, this proves you the in game controls have no effect on how easy a menu is to navigate. Some people marked the menus down because of the UI on the screen that said "join" however you could not click on it which confused several people. This should be changed  </p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=1627782857&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p> I personally thought that the loading time while going into games was very long for such a small game so I asked in my questionnaire if users thought that it took away from the game, to which most of them said it had no effect or it had a tiny effect. This surprised me as sometimes you'd be waiting fiveteen seconds plus for a small level to load. </p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=1326297101&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p> Since the game is controller reccomended I asked the users who did my questionnaire if the game would be more fun with a controller.  I was quite surprised with the results as I predicted that since it was a couch coop game that the majority of people would find it more fun with a controller however just over 50% said the controller would make it more fun. This makes me think that they just didn't enjoy the gameplay in general.  </p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=1134149272&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p>To further back my point about people not liking the gameplay I asked if people thought the art style suited the game. </p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=879941456&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p>overwhelmingly three quarters said it suited the game but then when asked would they play the game again was a different story. </p>
							<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTr20PGNMxZHRjvYGjys4RrLhQPkmxb51tyMDyrlPmXhIwvvqX_e4HseJZYDdqHqcONYB1b9nxgCtQx/pubchart?oid=935256880&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
							<p>This further proves that although you've found an art style that suits your game and makes it look nice the tutorial, controls and actual gameplay play a very large factor in deciding whether or not users would play again. </p>
							<p>The timed task I set four people to do showed me that the only person who took time to read the controls on the menu before playing the tutorial wasn't spamming the keyboard trying to decided if controls were broken or switched places. This is why when making a tutorial you need to make sure the keys demonstrated actually work for the player or else it causes a lot of confusion and takes away from the experience of the game. </p>
							<p>The most common feedback I recieved while doing these tests were to change the controls and implement a step by step tutorial. The tutorial would show you the controls bit by bit so you'd have to  </p>
